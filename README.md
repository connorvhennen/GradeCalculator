This project uses Qt and C++ to create a desktop application with a user interface, where the user can slide a student's scores on individual assignments, projects and exams, and have the final grade calculated automatically. Works for PIC 10A (Professor Salazar), PIC 10B (Professor Desalvo last quarter), and PIC 10C (Professor Salazar).
